The Tracking Algorithm

When an incoming request comes in check the request if its an application
request then show the menu.

else
if its a tracking URL then display the product being requested and create a log of this request
with the necessary information.

process the payment request for the user who clicked on the URL being tracked. processing is done through PAYPAL.
allocate the commissions to the owner of tracking URL, update the stock, update tracking statistics for the affiliate and affiliate partner
update the affiliate commission(balance), update the affiliate partner commission(balance). update the main system statistics update the main system balance Commission.
Show the user a message regarding this system and the fact that they can join it.
Show the user an advert from Google Adsense.







{another thought the payments can also be processed on the affiliates website meaning we can have an affiliate marketing website based on word-press
with all the data and necessary images for all the services and products, and when a click is made to purchase the tracking URL is activated once the purchase
goes through a notification is sent to the Google-App, which will then run the updates as Necessary.

then all the affiliates will just get shops that they run and once they activate the payment system they are taken to
Google-App where they fill in the information as requested and get all the products they can promote. once everything is verified.
then their system starts running and generate an income for them.
